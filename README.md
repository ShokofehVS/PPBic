# PPBic

**PPBic**: **P**rivact-**P**reserving **Bic**lustering algorithm based on function secret sharing

Privacy-preserving node-deletion-addition algorithm based on Cheng and Church Algorithm -- over gene expression data using Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) including additive secret sharing and function secret sharing in Python under the MIT license.

We apply [Funshade](https://github.com/ibarrond/funshade) for function secret sharing in 2PC protocol.
